NOTE: As of now, this only works on Windows.

Okay, so a couple of steps before you can use this mod.

For one, locate your storage folder in your Starbound directory.
In your starbound.config is a parameter called "safeScripts". Set this to false.
Then, in the same folder, create a new folder called "computers" (without the quotes, of course).

Now, start up your game and set up a computer. You can make a quick one by
spawning it in the following items:

/spawnitem computer1
/spawnitem cpu20
/spawnitem ram2
/spawnitem gpu4
/spawnitem harddrive
/spawnitem monitor1

Once that's done, place them in your computer in whatever order you like.
Place the monitor close enough to your computer that you're able to use the wiring tool to connect the two.
Restart your game. If done successfully, you should see a new folder pop up in your
storage/computers directory. Copy the contents of the folder "StarOS" into this if you
want to get straight to programming, or feel free to make your own OS from here.
