This is a mod I've been working on for a bit, which adds in programmable computers to the game Starbound.
As of now, I'm still working on the actual code, with this repository simply being set up when I'm ready to upload said code.

Hopefully this goes well!

# Prerequisites

This mod requires the setting "safeScripts" to be false.

Your starbound.config can be found in your storage folder, where the setting can be changed.

# Credits

I used two websites for creation of the mod logo, both of which are listed below:
